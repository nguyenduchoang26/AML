    "    1. The data used for solving the problem is clearly documented\n",
    "    1. The data preprocessing and feature calculation is clearly justified, explained and implemented. Excellent report cites research literature to justify the case.\n",
    "    1. Appropriate machine learning algorithms are chosen, the choice is rationally justified indicating knowledge of various machine learning methods, and the implementation is cleanly coded and explained using comments in the code. Again excellent report cites research literature in this phase.\n",
